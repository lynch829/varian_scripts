- **seaborn** is built on top of matplotlib and allows you to easily produce prettier (and more complex) visualizations.
- **D3.js** is a JavaScript library for producing sophisticated interactive visualizations for the web. Although it is not in Python, it is both trendy and widely used, and it is well worth your while to be familiar with it.
- **Bokeh** is a newer library that brings D3-style visualizations into Python. • ggplot is a Python port of the popular R library ggplot2, which is widely used for creating “publication quality” charts and graphics. It’s probably most interesting if you’re already an avid ggplot2 user, and possibly a little opaque if you’re not.
